Mr. JPrograms is the creator of this idea. Refer to:

This is a native program I ported to Rust from the JavaScript version I wrote.
You can find that version here: https://github.com/Tombez/colorPop

This is one of my first projects in Rust, so the code is a bit rough.
If you have a helpful suggestion, feel free to open an issue.

For dependencies, look at `/Cargo.toml` file.
I'm using a Rust wrapper around SDL2 for rendering and window management.
